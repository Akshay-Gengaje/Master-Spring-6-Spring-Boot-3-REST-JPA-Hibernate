# JDBC vs Spring JDBC



| Feature                      | JDBC                                                                                              | Spring JDBC                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**               | A Java API that provides standard methods to connect and interact with relational databases.      | A part of the Spring Framework that simplifies JDBC operations and error handling.                                                     |
| **Configuration**            | Requires manual configuration of database connections and SQL statements.                         | Provides a simplified configuration mechanism using Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) container.                                     |
| **Error Handling**           | Manual error handling using `SQLException`.                                                       | Simplifies error handling with DataAccessException, allowing for a more consistent approach to handling various database exceptions.   |
| **Resource Management**      | Requires explicit closing of connections, statements, and result sets.                            | Automatically manages resource closing through the use of `JdbcTemplate` and other classes, reducing the risk of resource leaks.       |
| **Boilerplate Code**         | Requires writing extensive boilerplate code for connection management and query execution.        | Significantly reduces boilerplate code by providing templates (like `JdbcTemplate`) that handle repetitive tasks automatically.        |
| **Transaction Management**   | Requires manual management of transactions using `Connection` methods.                            | Integrates seamlessly with Spring's transaction management, allowing for declarative transaction management using annotations.         |
| **SQL Injection Protection** | Developers need to use `PreparedStatement` to prevent SQL injection manually.                     | Encourages the use of `PreparedStatement` through its templates, which are inherently designed to prevent SQL injection.               |
| **Flexibility**              | More flexible in terms of database operations but requires more effort.                           | Provides a higher level of abstraction, making it easier for developers to perform common tasks without detailed database knowledge.   |
| **Integration**              | Integrates directly with JDBC drivers; manual setup is needed for different databases.            | Provides built-in support for various data sources and integrates with the Spring ecosystem (like Spring Data, Spring Boot).           |
| **Testing**                  | Testing can be cumbersome; requires setting up database connections and managing states.          | Easier testing with Springâ€™s mocking capabilities and the ability to use in-memory databases for unit tests.                           |
| **Maintenance**              | As the application grows, maintaining JDBC code can become complex and cumbersome.                | Easier maintenance due to the abstraction provided by Spring; easier to implement changes with less impact on the overall application. |
| **Support for Features**     | Limited support for advanced features (like batch processing) and requires manual implementation. | Provides built-in support for batch processing, pagination, and other features through its templates.                                  |
| **Learning Curve**           | Steeper learning curve for beginners due to manual configurations and error handling.             | Easier for beginners to pick up due to the high-level abstractions and better documentation.                                           |

### Summary

- **JDBC** is a low-level API that offers direct access to the database but requires a lot of manual work, such as connection management, error handling, and transaction control.
- **Spring JDBC** builds on JDBC by providing a higher-level abstraction that simplifies database access and reduces boilerplate code. It integrates seamlessly with the broader Spring ecosystem, making it easier to build, manage, and maintain data-driven applications.

Using **Spring JDBC** can enhance productivity and code maintainability, especially in larger applications, while **JDBC** is still valuable for scenarios that require fine-grained control over database interactions.
