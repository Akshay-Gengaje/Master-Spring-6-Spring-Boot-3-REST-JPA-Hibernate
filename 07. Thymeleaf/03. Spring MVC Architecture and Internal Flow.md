# Spring MVC architecture and Internal Flow

**Spring MVC** is a framework that follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern and provides a robust platform for developing scalable web applications. It handles incoming HTTP requests, maps them to appropriate controller methods, and returns responses, often as views rendered using template engines like Thymeleaf or JSP.

### Key Components of Spring MVC

1. **DispatcherServlet**: 
   
   - The **DispatcherServlet** acts as the front controller in Spring MVC. It intercepts incoming HTTP requests and delegates them to the appropriate controller.
   - It is responsible for managing the overall flow of the application, coordinating the request handling, invoking controllers, rendering views, and managing the lifecycle of the request.

2. **Controller**:
   
   - The **Controller** is where the main application logic is implemented. It handles the user's requests, processes them (often by interacting with the **Model**), and returns a view name or object as a response.
   - It uses annotations like `@Controller` and `@RequestMapping` to define request mapping methods.

3. **Model**:
   
   - The **Model** in Spring MVC contains the data that is passed to the view. It often encapsulates business logic and retrieves data from the database or other data sources.
   - In Spring, `Model` and `ModelAndView` objects are used to pass data to the view layer.

4. **View**:
   
   - The **View** represents the presentation layer (HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.). It is responsible for displaying the data provided by the **Model**.
   - The view is rendered using a **ViewResolver** in Spring, which maps logical view names to actual views (e.g., HTML files, JSP pages, etc.).

5. **ViewResolver**:
   
   - The **ViewResolver** resolves the logical view name returned by the controller into an actual view. Spring provides several view resolvers (e.g., `InternalResourceViewResolver` for JSP, `ThymeleafViewResolver` for Thymeleaf).

6. **HandlerMapping**:
   
   - **HandlerMapping** maps incoming requests to appropriate controller methods based on the URL patterns. It determines which controller method should handle the request.
   - Spring uses various `HandlerMapping` implementations (e.g., `RequestMappingHandlerMapping`) to map requests.

7. **HandlerAdapter**:
   
   - The **HandlerAdapter** is responsible for executing the handler method (controller) that is mapped by the **HandlerMapping**.
   - It serves as a bridge between the `DispatcherServlet` and controllers, ensuring that appropriate methods are invoked.

8. **ModelAndView**:
   
   - The **ModelAndView** object is a data structure that holds both the model (data) and the view (template name) that should be rendered to the user.

### Internal Flow of Spring MVC

The internal flow of Spring MVC follows a well-defined process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the request processing flow:

#### 1. **Client Request**

- The client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request (e.g., by typing a URL or submitting a form) to the web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

#### 2. **DispatcherServlet Intercepts the Request**

- The **DispatcherServlet** is configured as the front controller in the `web.xml` or through Java configuration in Spring Boot (it’s automatically configured in Spring Boot).
- It intercepts all incoming requests to the application.

#### 3. **HandlerMapping Resolution**

- The **DispatcherServlet** consults the **HandlerMapping** to determine which controller and method should handle the incoming request. The `@RequestMapping` annotations in the controller define the mappings between URL paths and controller methods.
- The appropriate controller and method are selected based on the URL pattern.

#### 4. **HandlerAdapter Execution**

- The **DispatcherServlet** uses a **HandlerAdapter** to invoke the appropriate method of the controller. This allows different types of controllers (e.g., `@Controller`-annotated classes or special handler interfaces) to be invoked.

#### 5. **Controller Processing**

- The controller method processes the request by handling business logic, interacting with services, and manipulating the **Model** (data to be passed to the view).
- It returns a **ModelAndView** object, which contains the model data and the logical name of the view to be rendered.

#### 6. **ViewResolver**

- The **DispatcherServlet** sends the view name to a **ViewResolver**. The **ViewResolver** resolves the logical view name to a specific view resource (e.g., a Thymeleaf template or JSP file).
- Spring supports different types of view resolvers like `InternalResourceViewResolver`, `ThymeleafViewResolver`, etc.

#### 7. **View Rendering**

- The resolved view (e.g., a JSP page or Thymeleaf template) is rendered using the model data provided by the controller.
- The view is then sent as the HTTP response to the client.

#### 8. **Response Sent to Client**

- The HTTP response, often in the form of an HTML page, is sent back to the client’s browser for rendering.
