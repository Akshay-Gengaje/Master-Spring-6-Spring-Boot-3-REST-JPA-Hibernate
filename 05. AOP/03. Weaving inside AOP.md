# Weaving inside AOP -

In Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), **weaving** refers to the process of integrating aspects with the target object (or code). Aspects are used to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, or transaction management. The primary goal of weaving is to insert the aspect's behavior into the target object's execution at specified join points without modifying the actual source code of the application.

Weaving can happen at different stages of the application lifecycle, and there are various types of weaving depending on when it occurs.

### Types of Weaving in Spring AOP

1. **Compile-time Weaving**:

   - This type of weaving occurs during the compilation of the source code. The aspect is woven into the target classes as the code is compiled.
   - It requires a special compiler (like AspectJ's compiler, `ajc`) that understands AOP annotations and directives.
   - Spring AOP doesn’t natively support compile-time weaving, but AspectJ does. However, Spring can work in combination with AspectJ for this purpose.

2. **Load-time Weaving (LTW)**:

   - In load-time weaving, the weaving happens when the classes are being loaded by the classloader.
   - This requires a special classloader or class file transformer (often provided by AspectJ).
   - The weaving is done before the class is loaded into memory. This is a more dynamic approach compared to compile-time weaving because it allows aspects to be added to already compiled classes during runtime.
   - In Spring, you can configure load-time weaving with AspectJ using the `@EnableLoadTimeWeaving` annotation or using XML configuration.

3. **Runtime Weaving (Proxy-based Weaving)**:
   - This is the most common weaving method in Spring AOP.
   - Weaving happens at runtime by dynamically creating proxies around the target objects.
   - Spring uses **JDK dynamic proxies** or **CGLIB proxies** to weave aspects at runtime.
     - **JDK dynamic proxies**: This is used when the target object implements one or more interfaces. Spring creates a proxy that implements the same interfaces and intercepts method calls.
     - **CGLIB proxies**: If the target class doesn’t implement an interface, Spring uses CGLIB to create a subclass of the target object at runtime and weave the aspects into it.
   - Since this approach happens at runtime, it doesn’t require any special compiler or classloader, making it more flexible but slightly less performant than compile-time weaving.

### Steps Involved in Weaving (Runtime Weaving with Spring AOP)

1. **Aspect Definition**: An aspect is created using annotations or XML. Aspects are composed of advice (the code that needs to be injected) and pointcuts (conditions specifying when the advice should be applied).

   - Example:
     ```java
     @Aspect
     public class LoggingAspect {
         @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
         public void logBeforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
             System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Proxy Creation**: When a Spring bean is created, Spring checks if there are any aspects associated with the bean. If yes, it creates a proxy (either using JDK dynamic proxy or CGLIB proxy).

   - The proxy wraps the actual target object, and whenever a method call happens on the target object, it passes through the proxy first.

3. **Advice Execution**: Based on the defined pointcut, the proxy determines if the advice should be applied. If the join point (method call) matches the pointcut, the advice is executed.

4. **Proceed with Method Execution**: Once the advice completes, the original method on the target object is executed, or, in the case of `@Around` advice, the method execution can be skipped, altered, or delayed.

### Weaving Example (Spring AOP with Runtime Weaving)

Consider a service class and an aspect to log before the method invocation.

#### Service Class

```java
public class UserService {
    public void addUser() {
        System.out.println("Adding a user...");
    }
}
```

#### Aspect Class

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* UserService.addUser(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging before method execution: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```

#### Configuration

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        return new UserService();
    }

    @Bean
    public LoggingAspect loggingAspect() {
        return new LoggingAspect();
    }
}
```

#### Result of Weaving

When `userService.addUser()` is called, the following happens:

1. Spring creates a proxy for the `UserService` bean.
2. When `addUser()` is called on the proxy, it checks for aspects associated with the method.
3. The `logBefore()` advice from `LoggingAspect` is executed before the `addUser()` method.
4. The actual `addUser()` method is then invoked.

**Output:**

```
Logging before method execution: addUser
Adding a user...
```

### Spring AOP vs AspectJ Weaving

- **Spring AOP**: Limited to method-level weaving, and uses proxy-based runtime weaving. It's simpler but not as powerful as AspectJ.
- **AspectJ**: Provides complete aspect-oriented programming features, including compile-time, load-time, and runtime weaving. It can weave aspects into classes at a finer level (not just method calls) but requires more setup.

### Weaving Summary

- Weaving is the process of applying aspects to a target object.
- It can happen at compile time, load time, or runtime, with Spring AOP typically using runtime weaving through proxies.
- Proxy-based weaving is the most common form in Spring AOP, allowing method interception without altering the source code.
