# Path and Query Params -

Query parameters and path parameters are both used to pass information to web applications through URLs, but they serve different purposes and are used in different ways.

### Path Parameters

- **Definition:** Path parameters are part of the URL path and are used to identify a specific resource or endpoint. They are embedded directly in the URL structure.

- **Usage:** Path parameters are typically used to identify resources or to perform actions on specific resources. For example, in a RESTful API, you might use path parameters to access a specific user's profile or an individual item in a collection.

- **Syntax:** In the URL, path parameters are usually enclosed in curly braces `{}` in the route definition.
  Example:
  
  ```plaintext
  /users/{userId}
  ```
  
  In this case, `userId` is a path parameter that will be replaced with an actual user ID when making the request.

- **Example URL:** `/users/12345`
  In this example, `12345` is the value of the `userId` path parameter.

### Query Parameters

- **Definition:** Query parameters are used to pass additional information to the server in the form of key-value pairs. They are appended to the end of the URL after a question mark `?`.

- **Usage:** Query parameters are often used for filtering, sorting, or pagination. They provide additional context or specify options for the request.

- **Syntax:** Query parameters are added to the URL after the `?` and are separated by `&` if there are multiple parameters.
  Example:
  
  ```plaintext
  /users?age=25&sort=desc
  ```
  
  In this case, `age` and `sort` are query parameters with values `25` and `desc`, respectively.

- **Example URL:** `/users?age=25&sort=desc`
  Here, `age=25` specifies that we want users who are 25 years old, and `sort=desc` indicates that the results should be sorted in descending order.

### Summary

- **Path Parameters:** Part of the URL path, used to specify a resource.
- **Query Parameters:** Appended to the end of the URL, used to provide additional filtering or sorting options.

Both types of parameters help in making API requests more flexible and precise.
