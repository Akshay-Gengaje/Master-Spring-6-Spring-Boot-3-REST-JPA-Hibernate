# @Qualifier Annotation

The `@Qualifier` annotation in Spring is used to disambiguate bean injections when multiple beans of the same type are available. It's particularly useful in situations where you have more than one bean of a specific type, and you want to specify which one should be injected.

### Scenario: The Problem of Ambiguity
Imagine you have a Spring application with the following setup:

```java
@Component
public class ServiceA {
}

@Component
public class ServiceB {
}
```

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    private final ServiceA service;

    @Autowired
    public MyComponent(ServiceA service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
}
```

Here, the `MyComponent` class depends on `ServiceA`. If you have two beans of the same type, such as:

```java
@Component("serviceA1")
public class ServiceA implements SomeInterface {
}

@Component("serviceA2")
public class ServiceA implements SomeInterface {
}
```

When Spring tries to autowire `ServiceA` in `MyComponent`, it will encounter an ambiguity because it wonâ€™t know which `ServiceA` bean to inject: `serviceA1` or `serviceA2`. This is where `@Qualifier` comes in handy.

### Using `@Qualifier` to Resolve Ambiguity

To resolve this ambiguity, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify exactly which bean should be injected.

#### Example:

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    private final ServiceA service;

    @Autowired
    public MyComponent(@Qualifier("serviceA1") ServiceA service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
}
```

Here, the `@Qualifier("serviceA1")` annotation tells Spring to inject the `serviceA1` bean into `My
