# @OneToOne Annotation -

In Spring Data JPA, the `@OneToOne` annotation is used to define a one-to-one relationship between two entities. It means that a single entity instance of one type is associated with a single entity instance of another type. This type of mapping is commonly used when one entity should reference exactly one other entity and vice versa.

### Structure of `@OneToOne` Mapping

```java
@Entity
public class EntityA {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id")
    private EntityB entityB;

    // getters and setters
}
```

Here, `EntityA` has a one-to-one relationship with `EntityB`. This means that one instance of `EntityA` corresponds to exactly one instance of `EntityB` and vice versa.

### Key Properties of `@OneToOne`

1. **`mappedBy`**
   
   - This property is used to specify the entity that owns the relationship. In a bidirectional one-to-one relationship, one side should be marked as the owner of the relationship, while the other side should be marked as the inverse, or referencing, side using `mappedBy`.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class EntityA {
       @OneToOne(mappedBy = "entityA")
       private EntityB entityB;
   }
   
   @Entity
   public class EntityB {
       @OneToOne
       @JoinColumn(name = "entity_a_id")
       private EntityA entityA;
   }
   ```
   
   In this example, `EntityB` owns the relationship (i.e., it contains the foreign key column), while `EntityA` refers to it using `mappedBy = "entityA"`.

2. **`fetch`**
   
   - This property determines how the associated entity is fetched, whether lazily or eagerly. By default, the fetch type for `@OneToOne` is `FetchType.EAGER`. However, it can be overridden if lazy loading is preferred.
   
   - **FetchType.EAGER**: The related entity is fetched immediately when the parent entity is fetched. This can lead to performance issues if not managed carefully.
   
   - **FetchType.LAZY**: The related entity is fetched only when explicitly accessed, improving performance in scenarios where the relationship is not always needed.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```

3. **`cascade`**
   
   - This property allows operations (like persist, remove, etc.) to be propagated from the parent entity to the associated entity. It is useful in situations where you want to ensure that changes to one entity affect its related entity.
   
   Cascade types:
   
   - `CascadeType.PERSIST`: Persist the associated entity when the parent is persisted.
   - `CascadeType.MERGE`: Merge changes in the parent to the associated entity.
   - `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Remove the associated entity when the parent is removed.
   - `CascadeType.REFRESH`: Refresh the state of the associated entity when the parent is refreshed.
   - `CascadeType.DETACH`: Detach the associated entity when the parent is detached.
   - `CascadeType.ALL`: Apply all of the above cascade operations.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```

4. **`optional`**
   
   - This property indicates whether the relationship is optional or not. If set to `false`, the relationship is mandatory, meaning the associated entity must always exist. The default value is `true`.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @OneToOne(optional = false)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```

5. **`orphanRemoval`**
   
   - When set to `true`, this property ensures that the associated entity is automatically removed if it is no longer referenced by the parent entity. This is useful in cases where you want the associated entity to be deleted when it is no longer needed.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @OneToOne(orphanRemoval = true)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```

6. **`targetEntity`**
   
   - This property specifies the type of the associated entity. Usually, this is inferred automatically, but it can be explicitly set if necessary.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @OneToOne(targetEntity = EntityB.class)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```

### Example: One-to-One Relationship with a Shared Primary Key

In some cases, you may want to use a shared primary key for both entities. In this scenario, the foreign key in one entity is also the primary key for both.

```java
@Entity
public class EntityA {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @MapsId // Shares the same primary key as EntityA
    @JoinColumn(name = "id")
    private EntityB entityB;
}
```

In this case, `EntityB` shares the same primary key as `EntityA`. The `@MapsId` annotation ensures that the primary key of `EntityB` is the same as `EntityA`.

### Example: Bidirectional One-to-One Mapping

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "employee", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id")
    private Employee employee;
}
```

In this example:

- `Employee` has a bidirectional one-to-one relationship with `Address`.
- `mappedBy` is used on the `Employee` side to indicate that `Address` owns the relationship.
- `CascadeType.ALL` ensures that changes to `Employee` cascade to the associated `Address`.

### Practical Use Cases of `@OneToOne`

1. **User Profile and Address**: A user may have exactly one profile and one address. A `@OneToOne` relationship can model this scenario.
2. **Order and Shipment**: An order may be linked to exactly one shipment. The relationship between them is modeled as a one-to-one association.
3. **Employee and Parking Space**: An employee may be assigned one parking space, which is unique to that employee.

### Summary

- `@OneToOne` is used to map a one-to-one association between two entities.
- Key properties include `mappedBy`, `fetch`, `cascade`, `optional`, `orphanRemoval`, and `targetEntity`.
- Relationships can be unidirectional or bidirectional, with one side owning the foreign key.
- Various cascade types allow for managing the lifecycle of the associated entity.
