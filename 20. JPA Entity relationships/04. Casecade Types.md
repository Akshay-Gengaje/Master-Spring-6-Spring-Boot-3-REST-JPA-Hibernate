# Casecade Types -

In JPA (Java Persistence API), the **cascade types** define how operations performed on one entity propagate to its related entities. In a relational database, entities often have relationships with other entities (such as `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@ManyToMany`). JPA provides cascade options to manage how related entities should be handled when actions like persist, remove, or update are performed on the owning entity.

Cascade types are defined through the `cascade` attribute in association mappings, such as `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, or `@ManyToMany`.

### Cascade Types

There are six cascade types in JPA:

1. **`CascadeType.PERSIST`**
2. **`CascadeType.MERGE`**
3. **`CascadeType.REMOVE`**
4. **`CascadeType.REFRESH`**
5. **`CascadeType.DETACH`**
6. **`CascadeType.ALL`**

### 1. `CascadeType.PERSIST`

When `CascadeType.PERSIST` is specified, any **persist** operation (i.e., saving a new entity) on the parent entity will also trigger a persist operation on its related entities. This means that the child entity will be persisted automatically when the parent entity is persisted.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

In this example, when you save an `Author` entity, its associated `Profile` entity will also be saved automatically if it is not already present in the database.

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = new Author();
Profile profile = new Profile();
author.setProfile(profile);

// When you persist the author, the profile will also be persisted automatically
entityManager.persist(author);
```

#### Key Points:

- `CascadeType.PERSIST` only propagates the `persist()` operation.
- If the parent is already persisted (detached state), and you want to merge changes, `CascadeType.PERSIST` will not work. For this, you need `CascadeType.MERGE`.

### 2. `CascadeType.MERGE`

`CascadeType.MERGE` causes a **merge** operation to cascade from the parent entity to its related entities. A merge operation means that any changes made to the parent and child entities will be propagated to the database.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);
Profile profile = author.getProfile();
profile.setBio("Updated bio");

entityManager.merge(author); // The changes to profile are also merged
```

#### Key Points:

- `CascadeType.MERGE` ensures that changes to both the parent and the associated entities are synchronized with the database when a merge operation occurs.
- If the parent entity is detached (not in the persistence context), and the child is updated, `CascadeType.MERGE` propagates those updates to the child entities.

### 3. `CascadeType.REMOVE`

`CascadeType.REMOVE` ensures that when the parent entity is **removed**, all its associated entities (child entities) are also removed. It propagates the `remove()` operation from the parent to its child entities.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);
entityManager.remove(author); // The associated Profile entity will also be removed
```

#### Key Points:

- `CascadeType.REMOVE` ensures that when you remove a parent entity, the related entities are deleted from the database.
- This is helpful in maintaining referential integrity when deleting entities that have dependent child entities.

### 4. `CascadeType.REFRESH`

`CascadeType.REFRESH` ensures that when the parent entity is **refreshed** from the database (i.e., reloaded), its associated child entities are also refreshed. This operation discards any unsaved changes and loads the latest state of the entity from the database.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.REFRESH)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);
Profile profile = author.getProfile();
profile.setBio("Temporary change");

// Refresh the author, the profile bio will be reloaded from the database
entityManager.refresh(author);
```

#### Key Points:

- `CascadeType.REFRESH` is useful when you want to reload both the parent and associated entities from the database, discarding any uncommitted changes.
- It restores the database state for both parent and child entities, ensuring consistency.

### 5. `CascadeType.DETACH`

`CascadeType.DETACH` ensures that when the parent entity is **detached** from the persistence context (i.e., becomes unmanaged), the associated entities are also detached. This means that neither the parent nor the child entities will be managed by the EntityManager after detachment.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.DETACH)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);
entityManager.detach(author); // The profile will also be detached
```

#### Key Points:

- Once an entity is detached, any changes made to it will not be synchronized with the database unless it is explicitly reattached using `merge()`.
- `CascadeType.DETACH` is helpful when you need to remove both the parent and child entities from the persistence context to prevent accidental modifications.

### 6. `CascadeType.ALL`

`CascadeType.ALL` is a shorthand for applying **all cascade operations** (`PERSIST`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`, `REFRESH`, `DETACH`). It means that all persistence operations performed on the parent entity will be cascaded to the child entities.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

#### Scenario:

```java
Author author = new Author();
Profile profile = new Profile();
author.setProfile(profile);

// Persist operation cascades to Profile
entityManager.persist(author);

// Detach operation cascades to Profile
entityManager.detach(author);

// Merge operation cascades to Profile
entityManager.merge(author);

// Remove operation cascades to Profile
entityManager.remove(author);

// Refresh operation cascades to Profile
entityManager.refresh(author);
```

#### Key Points:

- `CascadeType.ALL` is convenient when you want all operations to propagate from the parent to its associated entities.
- However, use this carefully as it applies every type of cascade, which might not always be desirable for all relationships.

### Understanding Cascade Types in the Context of Relationships

Cascade types are typically used in relationships between entities to ensure consistency and simplify the management of related entities. Hereâ€™s how cascade types work with different relationships:

#### 1. `@OneToOne`

In a one-to-one relationship, cascade types ensure that both entities in the relationship are kept synchronized. For example, saving a parent entity automatically saves the related child entity.

```java
@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
private Profile profile;
```

#### 2. `@OneToMany`

In a one-to-many relationship, cascade types allow the parent entity to manage the persistence lifecycle of its child entities.

```java
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "author")
private List<Book> books;
```

#### 3. `@ManyToOne`

`@ManyToOne` typically does not use cascades as often because a child entity (many side) might not want to cascade its persistence operations to its parent entity.

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
private Author author;
```

#### 4. `@ManyToMany`

In a many-to-many relationship, cascade types ensure that both sides of the relationship are synchronized. When managing the relationship, both entities are often updated or persisted together.

```java
@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinTable(name = "author_books",
           joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id"),
           inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id"))
private Set<Book> books;
```

### When to Use Each Cascade Type

- **`CascadeType.PERSIST`**: Use when you want new child entities to be automatically saved with the parent.
- **`CascadeType.MERGE`**: Use when you want changes to child entities to be propagated to the database during a merge operation.
