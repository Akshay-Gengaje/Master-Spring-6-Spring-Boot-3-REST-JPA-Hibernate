# @JoinColumn Annotation -

In Spring Data JPA, the `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the column that joins two entities in a relational database. It defines the foreign key column in the owning entity (the entity that holds the foreign key) and how it references the primary key of the associated entity.

The `@JoinColumn` annotation is generally used in conjunction with relationship annotations like `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@OneToMany` to configure the foreign key relationship between tables in the database.

### Structure of `@JoinColumn`

```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id")
private EntityB entityB;
```

In this example, `EntityA` is the owning entity and has a foreign key column `entity_b_id` that references the primary key of `EntityB`.

### Key Properties of `@JoinColumn`

1. **`name`**:
   
   - This specifies the name of the foreign key column in the owning entity. If `name` is not provided, JPA defaults to using the name of the associated entity's primary key field.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id")
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   This creates a foreign key column named `entity_b_id` in the table for `EntityA`.

2. **`referencedColumnName`**:
   
   - This specifies the name of the column in the target entity (the entity being referenced) that the foreign key refers to. By default, JPA uses the primary key of the referenced entity.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id", referencedColumnName = "custom_id")
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   In this case, `entity_b_id` in `EntityA` refers to `custom_id` in `EntityB`.

3. **`nullable`**:
   
   - This defines whether the foreign key column can contain `NULL` values. The default is `true`, meaning the column can be `NULL`. If set to `false`, the relationship is mandatory (i.e., the foreign key cannot be `NULL`).
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id", nullable = false)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   This enforces that `entity_b_id` in `EntityA` cannot be `NULL`.

4. **`unique`**:
   
   - This specifies whether the foreign key column should have a unique constraint. In a one-to-one relationship, this is typically set to `true` to ensure that each instance of `EntityA` references a unique instance of `EntityB`.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id", unique = true)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   This ensures that each `entity_b_id` in `EntityA` is unique, which is essential in a one-to-one mapping.

5. **`insertable` and `updatable`**:
   
   - These properties control whether the foreign key column should be included in SQL `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements, respectively. By default, both are `true`.
   - You might set `insertable = false` or `updatable = false` in situations where the column is managed elsewhere or is read-only in the context of the owning entity.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id", insertable = false, updatable = false)
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   In this case, `entity_b_id` will not be modified through SQL `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations on `EntityA`.

6. **`foreignKey`**:
   
   - This property is used to specify the foreign key constraint that should be applied. It can be used to customize the foreign key constraint name or type.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @JoinColumn(name = "entity_b_id", foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name = "FK_ENTITY_B"))
   private EntityB entityB;
   ```
   
   This creates a foreign key constraint with the name `FK_ENTITY_B` on the `entity_b_id` column.

### Example of `@JoinColumn` in a Bidirectional `@OneToOne` Mapping

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "parking_space_id", nullable = false)
    private ParkingSpace parkingSpace;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class ParkingSpace {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "parkingSpace")
    private Employee employee;

    // getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `Employee` entity has a one-to-one relationship with the `ParkingSpace` entity.
- The `@JoinColumn(name = "parking_space_id")` annotation specifies that `Employee` has a foreign key column `parking_space_id` referencing the primary key of the `ParkingSpace` entity.
- The `nullable = false` constraint ensures that every `Employee` must be assigned a `ParkingSpace`.

### Example of `@JoinColumn` in a `@ManyToOne` Mapping

```java
@Entity
public class Order {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    // Other fields
}
```

In this case:

- `Order` has a many-to-one relationship with `Customer`.
- The `@JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")` defines the foreign key column in the `Order` table that references the `id` column in the `Customer` table.

### Summary of `@JoinColumn` Properties

- `name`: Name of the foreign key column in the owning entity.
- `referencedColumnName`: The name of the column in the target entity (defaults to the primary key).
- `nullable`: Specifies whether the foreign key can be `NULL`.
- `unique`: Specifies whether the foreign key must be unique.
- `insertable` and `updatable`: Control whether the foreign key column is included in SQL `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements.
- `foreignKey`: Defines the foreign key constraint, including its name.

`@JoinColumn` is a crucial annotation for specifying foreign key relationships in Spring Data JPA, providing detailed control over the foreign key column configuration.
