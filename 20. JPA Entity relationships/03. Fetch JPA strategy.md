# Fetch JPA -



In Java Persistence API (JPA), **fetching strategies** control how related entities or collections of entities are loaded from the database. These strategies are important for optimizing performance by managing when and how associated data is retrieved. The fetch strategy impacts the way JPA retrieves associated entities for relationships such as `@OneToOne`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, and `@ManyToMany`.

JPA provides two main fetch types:

1. **EAGER Fetching** (`FetchType.EAGER`)
2. **LAZY Fetching** (`FetchType.LAZY`)

### 1. EAGER Fetching (`FetchType.EAGER`)

When a relationship is marked with `FetchType.EAGER`, the associated entities are loaded **immediately** when the parent entity is loaded, regardless of whether or not they are accessed in the business logic. This means that JPA will issue **joined queries** or additional **select statements** to fetch the associated entities eagerly.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

In this example, when an `Author` entity is retrieved, its associated `Profile` entity will also be fetched immediately due to the `FetchType.EAGER`.

#### Advantages:

- **Convenience**: You donâ€™t need to worry about whether the associated entities will be available when accessed. All necessary data is retrieved in a single operation.
- **Good for small, frequently accessed datasets**: If associated entities are small and are almost always needed when the parent entity is retrieved, eager fetching simplifies access.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Potential Performance Impact**: In cases where the associated entities are large or not always needed, EAGER fetching can lead to **unnecessary data loading**, slowing down performance.
- **More complex SQL queries**: EAGER fetching can generate SQL `JOIN` statements that retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, potentially making the query more complex and slower.
- **N+1 Select Problem**: EAGER fetching can cause the **N+1 problem**, where a query to retrieve multiple parent entities causes additional queries for each associated entity. This can lead to performance degradation.

### 2. LAZY Fetching (`FetchType.LAZY`)

`FetchType.LAZY` delays the loading of the associated entities until they are **explicitly accessed**. The related entity or collection is loaded only when its getter method is called (referred to as **lazy loading**).

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Profile profile;

    // Other fields, getters, setters
}
```

In this case, when an `Author` entity is retrieved, the associated `Profile` entity is **not** fetched immediately. Instead, the `Profile` will be fetched from the database only when its getter method (`getProfile()`) is called.

#### Advantages:

- **Optimized Performance**: LAZY fetching improves performance by avoiding the retrieval of unnecessary data. If the associated entities are not accessed, no additional queries are triggered.
- **Better for large datasets**: When associated entities or collections are large or rarely used, lazy fetching can prevent overhead by loading only the required data.

#### Disadvantages:

- **LazyInitializationException**: LAZY fetching can lead to a `LazyInitializationException` if an entity is accessed outside of the transaction where it was loaded. This happens when the entity is fetched lazily but accessed after the persistence context has been closed.
  **Example of LazyInitializationException**:
  
  ```java
  Author author = authorRepository.findById(1L); // Author is loaded
  entityManager.close(); // EntityManager is closed
  Profile profile = author.getProfile(); // Throws LazyInitializationException because the Profile is lazily loaded
  ```

- **Additional Queries**: If lazy-loaded entities are eventually accessed, JPA will issue additional `SELECT` statements, which may lead to inefficiencies if not handled carefully.

- **Complexity in management**: Developers must explicitly handle transactions and persistence contexts to ensure lazy-loaded entities can be safely accessed when needed.

### Configuring Fetch Types

By default, JPA uses different fetch types for different relationships:

- **@ManyToOne** and **@OneToOne**: The default is `FetchType.EAGER`.
- **@OneToMany** and **@ManyToMany**: The default is `FetchType.LAZY`.

The fetch type can be overridden using the `fetch` attribute on the relationship annotation, like this:

```java
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private Department department;
```

### How Fetch Strategies Work Internally

#### Eager Fetching Example:

```java
// Fetch an Author entity
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);

// Since Author has an EAGER relationship with Profile, JPA issues a query like:
SELECT a.*, p.*
FROM author a
LEFT JOIN profile p ON a.profile_id = p.id
WHERE a.id = 1;
```

In this query, JPA joins the `author` and `profile` tables to eagerly load both the `Author` and `Profile` entities.

#### Lazy Fetching Example:

```java
// Fetch an Author entity
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);

// No additional query for Profile at this point

// Now access the profile
Profile profile = author.getProfile();

// This triggers a lazy load, issuing a new query:
SELECT p.*
FROM profile p
WHERE p.id = :profile_id;
```

In this case, JPA fetches the `Author` entity first and only retrieves the `Profile` entity when it is accessed.

### The N+1 Select Problem

This problem occurs when you use EAGER fetching in a scenario where multiple parent entities are retrieved, and JPA issues separate queries for each associated entity. For example:

```java
List<Author> authors = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a").getResultList();
```

If `Author` has an EAGER relationship with `Profile`, and 10 authors are retrieved, JPA will issue the following queries:

1. The first query retrieves all authors:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT a.* FROM author a;
   ```
2. Then, for each author (N authors), JPA will issue N additional queries to retrieve each associated profile:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT p.* FROM profile p WHERE p.id = :profile_id;
   ```

Thus, if you have N authors, JPA will execute N additional queries for the associated `Profile` entities, leading to **N+1 queries** in total.

#### Solution to the N+1 Problem:

- **Use Fetch Joins**: You can use **fetch joins** in JPQL to avoid the N+1 issue by retrieving both the parent and the associated entities in a single query.
  Example:
  
  ```java
  List<Author> authors = entityManager
      .createQuery("SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.profile", Author.class)
      .getResultList();
  ```
  
  This query joins the `Author` and `Profile` tables, retrieving all authors and their associated profiles in one go, avoiding multiple queries.

### Choosing Between EAGER and LAZY Fetching

The choice of fetching strategy should depend on your use case:

- **Use LAZY fetching** when:
  
  - The associated entity or collection is large and not always needed.
  - You want to optimize for performance and load only what is necessary.
  - The relationship is only accessed in certain cases (e.g., details that are rarely viewed).

- **Use EAGER fetching** when:
  
  - The associated entity or collection is small and is always or almost always needed when the parent entity is loaded.
  - You want to avoid issues with lazy loading outside of transaction boundaries (e.g., to prevent `LazyInitializationException`).

### Summary

- **EAGER** (`FetchType.EAGER`): Immediately fetches associated entities when the parent entity is loaded.
- **LAZY** (`FetchType.LAZY`): Delays loading of associated entities until they are accessed.
- JPA defaults to **EAGER** for `@OneToOne` and `@ManyToOne`, and **LAZY** for `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany`.
- Fetch strategies must be carefully chosen based on performance needs and data access patterns to avoid pitfalls like the N+1 Select Problem and `LazyInitializationException`.
