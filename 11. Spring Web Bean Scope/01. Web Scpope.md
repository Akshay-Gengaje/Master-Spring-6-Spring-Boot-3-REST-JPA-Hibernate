# Web Bean Scopes in Spring Boot

In Spring Boot, **web scopes** are used to define the lifecycle of a Spring bean in a web application context. These scopes allow you to control when a bean is created, how long it should live, and when it should be destroyed. Spring Boot supports several web-specific scopes that extend the core scopes (`singleton` and `prototype`) for use in web applications.

### 1. **Request Scope**

- **Definition**: The bean is instantiated once per HTTP request and is discarded once the request completes.

- **Use Case**: Useful when the bean holds data specific to a single HTTP request, such as request parameters or form data.

- **Lifecycle**: Created at the start of the HTTP request and destroyed when the request is finished.
  
  ```java
  @Component
  @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
  public class RequestScopedBean {
      // Bean content specific to a single request
  }
  ```

- **Proxying**: Since a new bean is created for each request, you often need to use proxies (`ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS`) to inject this bean into other beans with a different scope, like singleton.

### 2. **Session Scope**

- **Definition**: The bean lives as long as the HTTP session is active.

- **Use Case**: Useful for storing user-specific data such as login information or preferences that should persist across multiple requests during a session.

- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created at the start of the session and destroyed when the session is invalidated.
  
  ```java
  @Component
  @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
  public class SessionScopedBean {
      // Bean content specific to a session
  }
  ```

- **Session Attributes**: You can associate the bean with session attributes to keep user data across requests. If the session expires, the bean is destroyed.

### 3. **Application Scope**

- **Definition**: The bean is created once per web application and is shared across all requests and sessions.

- **Use Case**: Useful for data that is application-wide, such as configuration settings or services that should be shared across all sessions and requests.

- **Lifecycle**: The bean is created when the web application starts and destroyed when the application shuts down.
  
  ```java
  @Component
  @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_APPLICATION)
  public class ApplicationScopedBean {
      // Application-wide bean
  }
  ```

- **Global Data**: This scope should only be used for global data that is not specific to any user or session.

### 4. **Request Context Scope**

- **Definition**: This scope is similar to the `request` scope but specifically tied to web request handling threads (e.g., for handling asynchronous web requests). Beans in this scope can survive across multiple threads handling the same request.
- **Use Case**: Typically used for advanced scenarios such as thread-bound beans in async processing.

### 5. **Session Context Scope**

- **Definition**: The `session context` scope is like the `session` scope but provides additional mechanisms for handling session-scoped beans during asynchronous operations.

### **Proxy Mode and Scoped Beans**

In Spring Boot web applications, beans defined in `request` or `session` scope often require a proxy to ensure correct instantiation and access. Since singleton beans typically do not interact well with scoped beans, Spring creates proxies to handle these interactions.

- **ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS**: The most common way to manage this is through class-based proxies, which ensure the scoped bean is fetched dynamically during each method call.
  
  ```java
  @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
  ```

- **ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES**: Interface-based proxies can be used when the bean is interacting through an interface. However, class-based proxies (`TARGET_CLASS`) are more frequently used in modern applications.

### **Custom Scopes**

Spring Boot also allows you to define custom scopes by implementing `Scope` interface. For example, you could create a custom scope for a particular user session or for any other business requirement.

### **Comparison of Scopes**

| Scope               | Bean Lifecycle                  | Typical Use Case                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton (Default) | One instance per Spring context | Shared service components, stateless beans   |
| Prototype           | New instance every time         | Stateful beans that require a fresh instance |
| Request             | One instance per HTTP request   | Request-specific data (e.g., forms)          |
| Session             | One instance per HTTP session   | User-specific data (e.g., session tracking)  |
| Application         | One instance per application    | Global configuration, shared data            |
| WebSocket           | One instance per WebSocket      | WebSocket session-specific data              |

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Thread Safety**: Beans in request and session scopes are inherently not thread-safe, so ensure that the objects stored in them are thread-safe if shared across multiple requests or threads.
- **Garbage Collection**: Session-scoped beans are eligible for garbage collection only when the session is invalidated, whereas request-scoped beans are eligible as soon as the request finishes.
- **ScopedProxyMode**: Often necessary to prevent issues when injecting a request/session scoped bean into a singleton bean.

Understanding these scopes helps design a well-structured, scalable Spring Boot web application that handles bean lifecycles effectively.
