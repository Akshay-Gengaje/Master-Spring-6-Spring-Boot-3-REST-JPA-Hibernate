# Request Bean Scope

The **request scope** in Spring is a special scope used in web applications. It defines the lifecycle of a Spring bean, ensuring that a new instance is created for each HTTP request and destroyed at the end of the request. This scope is particularly useful for managing request-specific data, such as form data or request parameters, which are relevant only during the lifetime of an HTTP request.

### 1. **Overview of Request Scope**

- **Lifecycle**: The request-scoped bean is created when an HTTP request is received and destroyed after the response is sent.
- **Use Case**: Typically used when data should be request-specific, such as:
  - HTTP request headers
  - URL query parameters
  - Form data
  - Any intermediate calculations during a request
- **Access**: It is not shared across different requests or sessions. Each HTTP request will get its own instance of the request-scoped bean.

### 2. **Enabling Request Scope in Spring Boot**

By default, Spring Boot supports `@Scope` annotations for beans, including the request scope, but to fully enable web scopes in a non-web Spring application, you must add the `spring-web` dependency.

### 3. **Creating a Request Scoped Bean**

A request-scoped bean can be defined using the `@Scope` annotation with the value set to `WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST`. Additionally, in most cases, it's essential to use proxying (explained later) to make request-scoped beans work properly when injected into beans with longer lifecycles (e.g., singleton beans).

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class RequestScopedBean {
    private String requestData;

    public String getRequestData() {
        return requestData;
    }

    public void setRequestData(String requestData) {
        this.requestData = requestData;
    }
}
```

In this example, `RequestScopedBean` will have a new instance for every HTTP request. It will be created when a request starts and destroyed after the request completes.

### 4. **How to Use Request Scoped Beans**

Request-scoped beans are often used in controllers to handle request data. Let’s say you want to store request data in a bean and process it in a controller.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class RequestController {

    @Autowired
    private RequestScopedBean requestScopedBean;

    @GetMapping("/processRequest")
    public String processRequest(@RequestParam String data) {
        // Set request-specific data
        requestScopedBean.setRequestData(data);

        // Simulate some business logic
        return "Processed: " + requestScopedBean.getRequestData();
    }
}
```

Here, each incoming HTTP request to the `/processRequest` endpoint will have its own `RequestScopedBean` instance, which can be used to handle request-specific data.

### 5. **Scope and Proxying**

#### Why Proxying Is Important

Beans with different scopes often have different lifecycles. For example, a request-scoped bean will be destroyed after a single HTTP request, while a singleton-scoped bean lives for the entire application’s lifetime. This can lead to problems if you try to inject a request-scoped bean into a singleton bean, as the singleton bean would try to use the same instance of the request-scoped bean across multiple requests, leading to incorrect behavior.

To solve this issue, Spring uses proxying. By creating a proxy for the request-scoped bean, Spring ensures that the actual bean instance is dynamically resolved at runtime based on the current HTTP request.

#### Proxy Mode

The `ScopedProxyMode` specifies how Spring should create proxies for the scoped bean. The most common options are:

- **ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS**: Creates a class-based proxy (uses CGLIB). This is the most commonly used option.
- **ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES**: Creates a proxy based on interfaces (uses Java proxy), which is useful if the bean implements an interface.

Example with class-based proxying:

```java
@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class RequestScopedBean {
    // Class contents...
}
```

The proxy will ensure that even if a request-scoped bean is injected into a singleton-scoped bean, the actual instance used will be specific to the current HTTP request.

### 6. **Request Scope in a Threaded Environment**

A common scenario is when a web request spawns multiple threads, but you still want to ensure that each thread uses the same request-scoped bean. Since Spring maintains request-scoped beans in the context of a single thread, you might encounter issues when trying to use request-scoped beans across multiple threads.

To solve this, you can use `RequestContextHolder` which binds the request scope to the current thread, ensuring that any thread spawned during the request can still access the correct request-scoped bean.

Example:

```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    RequestAttributes requestAttributes = RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes();
    RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes(requestAttributes);
    // Continue with the task using request-scoped beans
};
```

### 7. **Garbage Collection and Cleanup**

Request-scoped beans are garbage collected once the HTTP request completes, making them ideal for short-lived objects. Spring automatically handles the destruction of these beans after the request is processed. You don’t need to explicitly clean them up.

However, if a bean manages resources like file handles or database connections, you can define a `@PreDestroy` method to release those resources when the bean is about to be destroyed.

```java
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() {
    // Release resources
}
```

### 8. **Request Scope in Unit Testing**

When unit testing Spring controllers or services that rely on request-scoped beans, you might face issues since there is no real HTTP request. To mock request scope in tests, you can use `MockHttpServletRequest` or similar utilities provided by Spring's testing framework.

Example with `MockHttpServletRequest`:

```java
import org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpServletRequest;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.ServletRequestAttributes;

@Test
public void testRequestScopedBean() {
    MockHttpServletRequest request = new MockHttpServletRequest();
    RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes(new ServletRequestAttributes(request));

    // Test logic here
}
```

This ensures that your request-scoped beans work correctly even in a testing environment without an actual web request.

### 9. **Common Use Cases**

- **Form Data Handling**: Storing and processing form data unique to each request.
- **Request-Specific Caching**: Caching results for the duration of a request (e.g., database lookup results).
- **Logging and Auditing**: Maintaining log or audit trail data specific to a request.
- **Validation**: Keeping validation results for request input data during processing.

### **Conclusion**

The **request scope** in Spring Boot is vital for managing HTTP request-specific data and components in a stateless manner. By creating and destroying beans per request, it helps developers build scalable, stateless applications. The use of proxies ensures that even when interacting with beans of different scopes, the application functions as expected, with the appropriate bean lifecycle. Understanding this scope enables developers to handle request-based operations cleanly and efficiently.
