# Session Bean Scope -

The **session scope** in Spring is a specialized bean scope used in web applications. It defines the lifecycle of a bean to match the lifecycle of an **HTTP session**. This means a new instance of the bean is created when a session is started, and it persists as long as the session is active, shared across multiple HTTP requests made by the same user within that session.

### 1. **Overview of Session Scope**

- **Lifecycle**: A bean in the session scope is created once per HTTP session and is destroyed when the session is invalidated (either by user logout, session expiration, or explicitly by the server).
- **Use Case**: Typically used for storing user-specific data or maintaining user state across multiple requests within a session. Examples include:
  - Storing user preferences, shopping cart information, or login details.
  - Managing session-specific data across multiple requests.

### 2. **Session Scope Definition in Spring**

In Spring, the session scope is declared using the `@Scope` annotation with the value set to `WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION`. Just like with the request scope, it’s often necessary to use proxying to ensure the session-scoped bean interacts properly with beans of different scopes (e.g., singleton beans).

Here’s a basic example of how to define a session-scoped bean:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class SessionScopedBean {
    private String userName;

    public String getUserName() {
        return userName;
    }

    public void setUserName(String userName) {
        this.userName = userName;
    }
}
```

In this example, a new `SessionScopedBean` is created for each user session and will persist across multiple HTTP requests as long as the session is active.

### 3. **Key Characteristics of Session Scope**

#### 3.1. **Session Lifetime**

- A session-scoped bean is instantiated the first time it is needed within a user’s session.
- It remains in the session until the session ends. This could happen due to:
  - Explicit session invalidation (e.g., user logs out).
  - Session timeout (based on server settings).
  - Application restart.

#### 3.2. **Shared Across Requests**

Since an HTTP session typically spans multiple HTTP requests, the same session-scoped bean instance is shared across these requests. For example, if a user interacts with different parts of a web application (e.g., browsing different pages or performing multiple actions), the same instance of the session-scoped bean will be used for the duration of that session.

#### 3.3. **Concurrency Considerations**

Spring does not guarantee thread safety for session-scoped beans. Since a session can involve multiple requests being processed concurrently, it’s important to ensure that any session-scoped beans are thread-safe if they might be accessed simultaneously by different threads handling different requests.

### 4. **Session Scope in Action**

Here’s an example of a controller that uses a session-scoped bean to store user-specific information across multiple requests:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private SessionScopedBean sessionScopedBean;

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public String login(@RequestParam String userName) {
        sessionScopedBean.setUserName(userName);
        return "User " + userName + " is logged in!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/userInfo")
    public String getUserInfo() {
        return "Current user: " + sessionScopedBean.getUserName();
    }
}
```

- When a user logs in via the `/login` endpoint, their username is stored in the session-scoped bean.
- When the user makes a subsequent request to `/userInfo`, the same session-scoped bean is used, ensuring the user’s name is retained across multiple requests.

### 5. **Proxying and Scope Interactions**

#### 5.1. **ScopedProxyMode**

When injecting session-scoped beans into beans with different lifecycles (such as singleton beans), you need to use proxying. This ensures that the correct session-scoped instance is used based on the current session.

```java
@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class SessionScopedBean {
    // Class definition...
}
```

In the example above, `ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS` ensures that when a session-scoped bean is injected into a singleton-scoped or prototype-scoped bean, Spring uses a dynamic proxy to resolve the appropriate session-scoped instance.

#### 5.2. **How the Proxy Works**

The proxy acts as a placeholder, and when any method of the session-scoped bean is called, the proxy looks up the actual instance based on the current session. This ensures that the correct bean instance is used for each session, even when injected into beans of different scopes.

### 6. **Session Timeout and Bean Destruction**

A session-scoped bean will be destroyed when the HTTP session ends. The session can be invalidated in several ways:

- **Session Timeout**: The session will automatically expire after a period of inactivity, as defined by the server configuration (e.g., in Tomcat, this is configured via the `session-timeout` setting in `web.xml`).
- **Manual Invalidation**: A session can be explicitly invalidated using `HttpSession.invalidate()`, such as during a user logout.

You can define a `@PreDestroy` method in your session-scoped bean to handle cleanup tasks when the session ends:

```java
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class SessionScopedBean {

    private String userName;

    public String getUserName() {
        return userName;
    }

    public void setUserName(String userName) {
        this.userName = userName;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        // Perform cleanup tasks (e.g., releasing resources)
        System.out.println("SessionScopedBean for user " + userName + " is being destroyed.");
    }
}
```

### 7. **HTTP Session Configuration in Spring Boot**

By default, Spring Boot handles HTTP sessions using a servlet container’s session management (e.g., Tomcat or Jetty). However, Spring Boot also provides mechanisms to configure session management:

- **Session Timeout**: You can configure session timeout in `application.properties`:
  
  ```properties
  server.servlet.session.timeout=30m
  ```
  
  This example sets the session timeout to 30 minutes.

- **Session Persistence**: Spring Session can be used to externalize session management to a data store like Redis, providing session persistence across distributed applications.

### 8. **Session Attributes**

In Spring MVC, session-scoped beans can be automatically tied to the session attributes using `@SessionAttributes`. This provides a way to store session-scoped data without explicitly defining session-scoped beans.

Example:

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.SessionAttributes;

@Controller
@SessionAttributes("user")
public class UserController {

    @RequestMapping("/setUser")
    public String setUser(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("user", "John Doe");
        return "userSet";
    }

    @RequestMapping("/getUser")
    public String getUser(Model model) {
        String user = (String) model.getAttribute("user");
        return "User: " + user;
    }
}
```

Here, the user information is automatically stored as a session attribute and is available across multiple requests.

### 9. **Concurrency and Thread Safety**

Since session-scoped beans can be accessed by multiple requests from the same session, it's essential to consider thread safety. If the web application processes multiple requests from the same session concurrently (which is possible), the session-scoped bean could be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

To prevent issues, you should:

- Use thread-safe data structures (like `ConcurrentHashMap`).
- Synchronize access to shared resources within the session-scoped bean.

```java
@Component
@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class SessionScopedBean {

    private String userData;

    public synchronized String getUserData() {
        return userData;
    }

    public synchronized void setUserData(String userData) {
        this.userData = userData;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getUserData` and `setUserData` methods are synchronized to ensure thread safety within the session-scoped bean.

### 10. **Testing Session Scoped Beans**

In a testing environment, session-scoped beans can be tested using `MockHttpSession` provided by Spring’s testing utilities. This allows you to simulate a session environment without needing an actual web session.

Example:

```java
import org.springframework.mock.web.MockHttpSession;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.ServletRequestAttributes;

@Test
public void testSessionScopedBean() {
    MockHttpSession session = new MockHttpSession();
    RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes(new ServletRequestAttributes(new MockHttpServletRequest(), session));

    // Test session-scoped beans here
}
```

This way, the session-scoped bean behaves as it would in a real session.

### **Conclusion**

The **session scope** in Spring is a powerful way to manage user-specific data that needs to persist across multiple requests during a user’s session. It allows you to store and maintain session-specific state cleanly and efficiently. By leveraging session-scoped beans with appropriate proxying, handling thread safety, and managing session lifetime properly, you can build scalable, session-aware web applications.
