# Lombok Library -

The **Lombok library** is a Java library designed to reduce boilerplate code by providing annotations that automatically generate commonly used methods such as constructors, getters, setters, equals, hashcode, and toString. Lombok integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot and helps make the code cleaner, more concise, and readable.

### Why Lombok is Useful in Spring Boot?

Spring Boot applications often require a lot of boilerplate code, especially for POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), which usually involve getter/setter methods, constructors, and other utility methods. Writing this code manually can lead to repetitive and verbose code. **Lombok** solves this by using annotations to generate these methods at compile time.

### Key Lombok Annotations:

1. **@Getter and @Setter**
   
   - These annotations generate getter and setter methods for all fields in a class. If placed on individual fields, only that field gets the methods.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @Getter
   @Setter
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```
   
   The above code will automatically generate the `getName()`, `getAge()`, `setName(String name)`, and `setAge(int age)` methods.

2. **@ToString**
   
   - Generates the `toString()` method, which prints the object's fields in a human-readable format.
   - You can exclude certain fields or choose which fields to include by configuring the annotation.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @ToString
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```

3. **@EqualsAndHashCode**
   
   - Generates the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods based on the fields in a class. These methods are crucial when using objects in collections like `Set` or `Map`.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @EqualsAndHashCode
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```

4. **@NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @RequiredArgsConstructor**
   
   - These annotations automatically generate constructors:
     - `@NoArgsConstructor` creates a constructor with no arguments.
     - `@AllArgsConstructor` creates a constructor with arguments for all fields.
     - `@RequiredArgsConstructor` creates a constructor for fields marked as `final` or with `@NonNull` annotations.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @AllArgsConstructor
   @NoArgsConstructor
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```

5. **@Data**
   
   - This is a combination annotation that includes:
     - `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`.
   - It is ideal for simple POJOs.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @Data
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```

6. **@Builder**
   
   - This annotation provides the builder pattern for your class. It generates a nested static builder class that allows you to build an instance of the class step-by-step.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @Builder
   public class User {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }
   ```
   
   Usage:
   
   ```java
   User user = User.builder()
       .name("John")
       .age(30)
       .build();
   ```

7. **@NonNull**
   
   - This annotation adds null checks to the method parameters or fields. If a null value is passed, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   public void setName(@NonNull String name) {
       this.name = name;
   }
   ```

8. **@Value**
   
   - This annotation is used for immutable classes. It automatically makes all fields `private` and `final`, generates a constructor with all arguments, and provides getter methods.
   - It is a variant of `@Data`, optimized for immutable objects.
   
   Example:
   
   ```java
   @Value
   public class User {
       String name;
       int age;
   }
   ```

### Benefits of Using Lombok in Spring Boot

1. **Reduces Boilerplate Code:**
   
   - Saves time and effort by removing the need to write repetitive code.

2. **Readable Code:**
   
   - Enhances code readability by focusing on business logic rather than getters, setters, and constructors.

3. **Easier Maintenance:**
   
   - Reduces clutter, making the code easier to maintain.

4. **Performance:**
   
   - Lombok generates the necessary code at compile time, so there's no runtime overhead.

### How to Integrate Lombok with Spring Boot

1. **Add Lombok to Your Spring Boot Project:**
   
   - Add Lombok dependency to your `pom.xml` (for Maven):
     
     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
       <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
       <version>1.18.28</version>
       <scope>provided</scope>
     </dependency>
     ```
   - For Gradle:
     
     ```gradle
     compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
     annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.28'
     ```

2. **Enable Lombok in Your IDE:**
   
   - Most IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse) require a Lombok plugin. Ensure you have the Lombok plugin installed and enabled in your IDE for it to process Lombok annotations correctly.

### Conclusion

Lombok is a highly useful library in Spring Boot for eliminating repetitive boilerplate code, making the codebase concise, clean, and easier to manage. It speeds up development and ensures that you can focus on the application's core business logic without being distracted by tedious code like getters, setters, and constructors.
