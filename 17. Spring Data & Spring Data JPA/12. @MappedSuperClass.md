# @MappedSuperClass Annotation -

The `@MappedSuperclass` annotation in Spring Data JPA is used to define a base class for entity classes that share common fields. This is particularly useful in inheritance hierarchies where multiple entity classes need to inherit common properties without being directly part of the entity model themselves. The fields and methods defined in a `@MappedSuperclass` will be inherited by its subclasses, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.

### 1. Definition and Purpose

- **Purpose**: The `@MappedSuperclass` annotation allows you to create a base class that provides shared mapping information for all its subclasses. This means that the fields defined in the superclass will be part of the subclass's table in the database schema, but the superclass itself does not map to any table.
- **Location**: It is part of the `javax.persistence` package.

### 2. Basic Usage

You typically use the `@MappedSuperclass` annotation on a class that contains common fields that will be shared across multiple entity classes. Here’s a basic example:

```java
import javax.persistence.MappedSuperclass;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;

@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class BaseEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String createdAt;
    private String updatedAt;

    // Getters and setters
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getCreatedAt() {
        return createdAt;
    }

    public void setCreatedAt(String createdAt) {
        this.createdAt = createdAt;
    }

    public String getUpdatedAt() {
        return updatedAt;
    }

    public void setUpdatedAt(String updatedAt) {
        this.updatedAt = updatedAt;
    }
}
```

In this example, `BaseEntity` is a superclass that can be extended by other entities like `Author` or `Book`, which will inherit its fields.

### 3. Characteristics of @MappedSuperclass

- **No Table Mapping**: Classes annotated with `@MappedSuperclass` do not have their own database table. Instead, the fields defined in the superclass are included in the table of the subclass.
- **Inheritance**: The fields from the `@MappedSuperclass` are inherited by subclasses, which means you can define common fields only once.
- **No @Entity**: You do not need to annotate a `@MappedSuperclass` with `@Entity` since it does not represent a standalone entity.

### 4. Example of Subclasses Using @MappedSuperclass

Here’s how you would define entity subclasses that inherit from the `BaseEntity`:

```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
public class Author extends BaseEntity {
    private String name;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

@Entity
public class Book extends BaseEntity {
    private String title;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Author` and `Book` classes inherit the `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields from `BaseEntity`. Their respective tables in the database will include these fields.

### 5. Benefits of Using @MappedSuperclass

- **Code Reusability**: Common fields can be defined once and reused across multiple entities, reducing redundancy.
- **Maintainability**: Changes made to the common fields in the superclass automatically reflect in all subclasses, making maintenance easier.
- **Encapsulation**: You can encapsulate shared logic (such as methods) in the superclass, which enhances code organization.

### 6. Best Practices

- Use `@MappedSuperclass` when you have multiple entities that share common fields but do not require a separate table for the superclass.
- Keep the `@MappedSuperclass` class abstract to prevent it from being instantiated directly.
- Use proper naming conventions for base classes to clarify their role in the application.

### 7. Limitations

- **No Specific JPA Features**: Fields in a `@MappedSuperclass` cannot have specific JPA features like `@Version`, `@Enumerated`, etc., since the class itself does not map to a table.
- **Cannot Use @OneToMany or @ManyToMany**: Relationships defined in a `@MappedSuperclass` cannot have associations like `@OneToMany` or `@ManyToMany` since they are not tied to any specific table.

### Conclusion

The `@MappedSuperclass` annotation is a powerful feature in Spring Data JPA that allows you to define a common base for entity classes without requiring an actual table for the superclass. It promotes code reuse, maintainability, and organization in your entity structure, making it easier to manage shared properties across multiple entities in your application. Understanding and effectively using this annotation is key for creating a clean and efficient entity model in JPA applications.
