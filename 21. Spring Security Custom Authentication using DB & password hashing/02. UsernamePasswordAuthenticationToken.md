# UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken -

The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` class is a core part of Spring Security and is commonly used for handling user authentication with a username and password. To understand it fully, let's break it down from the basics.

### What is `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`?

`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is a class that represents an authentication request or an authentication result, depending on how it's used in the authentication process. It is an implementation of the `Authentication` interface, which is central to how Spring Security works.

- **Before authentication**: It holds the user’s credentials (i.e., username and password) that are submitted for authentication.
- **After authentication**: It holds additional details about the authenticated user, such as roles and permissions (authorities).

### Role of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` in Authentication

In Spring Security, authentication is typically a two-step process:

1. **Initial Authentication Request**:  
   When a user submits their credentials (username and password) for login, an instance of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created to hold these credentials.

2. **Authentication Result**:  
   Once the credentials are verified (usually by an `AuthenticationProvider` like `DaoAuthenticationProvider`), the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is updated to indicate that the user has been authenticated. It also contains the user’s granted authorities (roles or permissions).

### Constructor and Methods of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

The class has two important constructors, one for when the user is **unauthenticated** and one for when they are **authenticated**.

1. **Unauthenticated Constructor**
   This constructor is used when the user submits their login details. At this point, only the username and password are known, and the token is marked as unauthenticated.
   
   ```java
   public UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(Object principal, Object credentials)
   ```
   
   - `principal`: Typically the username.
   - `credentials`: Typically the password.
   
   **Example (unauthenticated token creation)**:
   
   ```java
   Authentication authentication = 
       new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken("user", "password");
   ```
   
   At this stage, the object simply holds the user’s credentials but does not yet have any information about whether the credentials are valid.

2. **Authenticated Constructor**
   This constructor is used when the user has been successfully authenticated. Along with the username and password, this token also holds the user’s authorities (roles or permissions).
   
   ```java
   public UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(Object principal, Object credentials, Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities)
   ```
   
   - `principal`: Usually the `UserDetails` object or username.
   - `credentials`: The password (you can set this to `null` after successful authentication for security purposes).
   - `authorities`: A collection of roles or permissions (such as `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`).
   
   **Example (after successful authentication)**:
   
   ```java
   Authentication authentication = 
       new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
   ```
   
   In this case, the token not only holds the username and password but also the granted authorities (e.g., roles) and is marked as authenticated.

### Fields in `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

Key fields of this class include:

1. **Principal**:  
   The principal is the identity of the user, typically the username or a `UserDetails` object that holds the user’s information (like username, password, authorities).
   
   - Before authentication, this is usually just the username.
   - After authentication, this may contain more information, such as a `UserDetails` object.

2. **Credentials**:  
   The credentials usually refer to the password (or other credentials like a token). Once authentication is complete, the credentials are often set to `null` for security reasons (so they are no longer available in memory).

3. **Authorities**:  
   Authorities are the roles or permissions granted to the user. These are usually represented as a collection of `GrantedAuthority` objects (e.g., `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`). This is only populated after successful authentication.

---

### Methods in `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

Here are some key methods:

- **`getPrincipal()`**: Returns the principal (i.e., the username or `UserDetails` object).
- **`getCredentials()`**: Returns the credentials (usually the password). Post-authentication, this is often set to `null`.
- **`getAuthorities()`**: Returns the authorities (roles/permissions) granted to the authenticated user. This is empty before authentication.
- **`isAuthenticated()`**: Returns `true` if the token represents an authenticated user, otherwise `false`.

### Example of How `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is Used

#### Step 1: Before Authentication (Unauthenticated Token)

When a user submits their login form with a username and password, an unauthenticated `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is created and passed to the `AuthenticationManager`:

```java
// This is before authentication
Authentication authRequest = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken("john_doe", "password123");

// Pass this to AuthenticationManager for authentication
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = getAuthenticationManager();
Authentication authResult = authenticationManager.authenticate(authRequest);
```

#### Step 2: After Authentication (Authenticated Token)

Once the authentication manager verifies the credentials, it returns an authenticated `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` that contains the user's roles and other details:

```java
// After successful authentication
UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername("john_doe");
Authentication authResult = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
    userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());
```

At this point, the `isAuthenticated()` method will return `true`, and the token now contains information about the authenticated user, including their roles (authorities).

### Summary

Here’s a quick summary of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`:

- **Before authentication**:  
  
  - Holds the user’s credentials (usually a username and password).
  - Used by Spring Security to initiate the authentication process.
  - The token is marked as unauthenticated.

- **After authentication**:  
  
  - Holds the authenticated user's details (like roles and authorities).
  - The token is marked as authenticated, and credentials (like passwords) are typically cleared from memory for security.

- **Methods and properties**:
  
  - `principal`: Holds user identity (username or `UserDetails`).
  - `credentials`: Holds password or other credentials.
  - `authorities`: Holds granted roles/permissions after authentication.

### Practical Use Case in a Spring Boot Security Application

1. A user sends a username and password in a login request.
2. Spring Security creates a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` with the provided credentials.
3. This token is passed to the `AuthenticationManager`, which checks the credentials using an `AuthenticationProvider`.
4. If successful, an authenticated `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is returned, now containing the user’s roles and other details.
5. The application can now use the authenticated token to determine what the user can access based on their roles (authorities).

By using `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`, Spring Security makes the process of handling and representing authentication simple and consistent across different types of security mechanisms.
