# @CreatedDate and @CreatedBy Annotation -

In Spring Data JPA, the `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy` annotations are part of the **auditing framework**. These annotations are used to automatically capture and store metadata about when an entity was created and by whom. They work in conjunction with **JPA Auditing**, which is typically enabled using the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation.

### 1. **`@CreatedDate` Annotation**

#### Purpose:

- The `@CreatedDate` annotation is used to mark a field in your entity that will store the **timestamp** when the entity is first created and persisted in the database.

#### Key Points:

- The field annotated with `@CreatedDate` is automatically populated when the entity is first persisted.
- This field should be of a date or time type such as `LocalDateTime`, `Date`, or `Instant`.
- You need to enable JPA auditing in your configuration class using `@EnableJpaAuditing`.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedDate;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @CreatedDate
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the `createdDate` field will automatically be populated with the current timestamp when the `Author` entity is persisted for the first time.

#### Requirements:

1. You must enable auditing by using the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation in a configuration class:
   
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableJpaAuditing
   public class JpaConfig {
   }
   ```
2. The entity should be either directly or indirectly associated with a repository that extends `JpaRepository` or similar Spring Data repository interface.

### 2. **`@CreatedBy` Annotation**

#### Purpose:

- The `@CreatedBy` annotation is used to capture and store the **user** who created the entity.
- This works with the **`AuditorAware`** interface, which is used to provide the current auditor (typically the current logged-in user).

#### Key Points:

- The field annotated with `@CreatedBy` stores the user who created the entity.
- This field could be of any type, depending on how you represent your user (e.g., `String`, `Long`, or a reference to a `User` entity).
- You must implement the `AuditorAware` interface to provide the current user.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedBy;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @CreatedBy
    private String createdBy;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the `createdBy` field will automatically be populated with the username or user ID when the `Author` entity is first created.

#### Requirements:

1. Implement the `AuditorAware` interface to return the current user:
   
   ```java
   import org.springframework.data.domain.AuditorAware;
   import java.util.Optional;
   
   public class AuditorAwareImpl implements AuditorAware<String> {
   
       @Override
       public Optional<String> getCurrentAuditor() {
           // You would typically fetch the current logged-in user here
           return Optional.of("AdminUser");
       }
   }
   ```

2. Register the `AuditorAware` bean in your Spring configuration:
   
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = "auditorAware")
   public class JpaConfig {
   
       @Bean
       public AuditorAware<String> auditorAware() {
           return new AuditorAwareImpl();
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Combining `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy`**

You can use both annotations in the same entity to automatically track both the creation time and the creator of the entity:

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedDate;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedBy;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @CreatedDate
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;

    @CreatedBy
    private String createdBy;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `createdDate` field will be automatically populated with the timestamp when the entity is persisted.
- The `createdBy` field will be populated with the username of the user who created the entity, based on the implementation of `AuditorAware`.

### 4. **Key Considerations**

- **Enable Auditing**: You must enable JPA auditing by adding the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation to your configuration.
- **AuditorAware Interface**: You must implement the `AuditorAware` interface to provide the current user or auditor.
- **Automatic Population**: Fields marked with `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy` are automatically populated during the entity lifecycle without requiring manual intervention.
- **Concurrency**: Auditing helps track who made changes to the entity, which can be important for maintaining a history of modifications in applications with multiple users.

### 5. **Summary of `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy`**

| **Annotation** | **Purpose**                                   | **Type**                      | **Dependency**                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `@CreatedDate` | Captures the creation timestamp of an entity. | `Date`, `LocalDateTime`, etc. | Requires JPA auditing to be enabled. |
| `@CreatedBy`   | Captures the user who created the entity.     | `String`, `Long`, etc.        | Requires `AuditorAware` interface.   |

### Conclusion

The `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy` annotations are powerful features in Spring Data JPA that allow for automatic tracking of when and by whom an entity was created. They help you build applications with auditing capabilities, enabling you to maintain clear records of entity creation and modification.
