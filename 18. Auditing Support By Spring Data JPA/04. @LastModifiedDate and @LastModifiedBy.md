# @LastModifiedDate and @LastModifiedBy Annotation -

In Spring Data JPA, the `@LastModifiedDate` and `@LastModifiedBy` annotations are part of the **auditing** framework, which allows automatic tracking of when an entity was last modified and by whom. They complement the `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy` annotations by focusing on updates to existing records.

These annotations are useful when you want to maintain a history of changes to your entities, ensuring that every update to an entity records the time and the user responsible for the modification.

### 1. **`@LastModifiedDate` Annotation**

#### Purpose:

- The `@LastModifiedDate` annotation is used to automatically store the timestamp of the **last modification** to an entity.
- It ensures that every time the entity is updated, the field is populated with the current date and time.

#### Key Points:

- This annotation works with fields of types like `LocalDateTime`, `Date`, `Instant`, etc.
- It only updates the field when an entity is modified (not when it is created).

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedDate;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @LastModifiedDate
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `lastModifiedDate` field is automatically updated every time the `Author` entity is modified.

#### Requirements:

1. **Enable JPA Auditing**: You must enable auditing in your Spring configuration using the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation.
   
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableJpaAuditing
   public class JpaConfig {
   }
   ```

2. **Auditing Fields Setup**: The field annotated with `@LastModifiedDate` will be automatically populated by the JPA Auditing mechanism, so no additional logic is needed to update it manually.

### 2. **`@LastModifiedBy` Annotation**

#### Purpose:

- The `@LastModifiedBy` annotation is used to automatically store the **user** who last modified the entity.
- Like `@CreatedBy`, it works in conjunction with the **`AuditorAware`** interface, which is responsible for providing the current user.

#### Key Points:

- The field annotated with `@LastModifiedBy` can be of any type representing the user (e.g., `String`, `Long`, or a reference to a `User` entity).
- It only updates the field when an entity is modified, not when it is created.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedBy;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @LastModifiedBy
    private String lastModifiedBy;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `lastModifiedBy` field is automatically updated with the username or user ID of the person who modified the `Author` entity.

#### Requirements:

1. **Implement the `AuditorAware` Interface**:
   You must implement the `AuditorAware` interface to provide the current user who modifies the entity.
   
   ```java
   import org.springframework.data.domain.AuditorAware;
   import java.util.Optional;
   
   public class AuditorAwareImpl implements AuditorAware<String> {
   
       @Override
       public Optional<String> getCurrentAuditor() {
           // Typically fetch the currently logged-in user (e.g., via SecurityContext)
           return Optional.of("CurrentUser");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Register the `AuditorAware` Bean**:
   In your Spring configuration class, register the `AuditorAware` implementation:
   
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = "auditorAware")
   public class JpaConfig {
   
       @Bean
       public AuditorAware<String> auditorAware() {
           return new AuditorAwareImpl();
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Combining `@LastModifiedDate` and `@LastModifiedBy`**

You can use both annotations in the same entity to track both the modification timestamp and the user who modified the entity.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedDate;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedBy;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @LastModifiedDate
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;

    @LastModifiedBy
    private String lastModifiedBy;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `lastModifiedDate` field is automatically populated with the timestamp of the last modification.
- The `lastModifiedBy` field is automatically populated with the username of the person who made the modification.

---

### 4. **Enabling Auditing for Both Created and Last Modified Fields**

It is common to use both `@CreatedDate`/`@CreatedBy` along with `@LastModifiedDate`/`@LastModifiedBy` to track both the creation and last modification details for an entity.

#### Example:

```java
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedDate;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedBy;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedDate;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.LastModifiedBy;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @CreatedDate
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;

    @CreatedBy
    private String createdBy;

    @LastModifiedDate
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;

    @LastModifiedBy
    private String lastModifiedBy;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- `createdDate` and `createdBy` fields track when and by whom the entity was first created.
- `lastModifiedDate` and `lastModifiedBy` fields track the last time and by whom the entity was updated.

### 5. **Auditing Fields Summary**

| **Annotation**      | **Purpose**                                           | **Field Type**          | **Dependency**                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `@LastModifiedDate` | Automatically stores the last modification date       | `LocalDateTime`, `Date` | Requires JPA auditing to be enabled. |
| `@LastModifiedBy`   | Automatically stores the user who modified the entity | `String`, `Long`, etc.  | Requires `AuditorAware` interface.   |
| `@CreatedDate`      | Stores the creation date of the entity                | `LocalDateTime`, `Date` | Requires JPA auditing to be enabled. |
| `@CreatedBy`        | Stores the user who created the entity                | `String`, `Long`, etc.  | Requires `AuditorAware` interface.   |

### 6. **Use Cases**

- **Auditing Systems**: These annotations are essential for creating audit trails in systems where tracking changes to data is critical.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Helps to ensure that the last changes to an entity are recorded, which is useful in systems with multiple users working simultaneously.
- **User Accountability**: Helps maintain records of who made changes and when, providing a detailed history of modifications in multi-user applications.

### Conclusion

The `@LastModifiedDate` and `@LastModifiedBy` annotations are powerful tools in the Spring Data JPA auditing framework. They enable automatic tracking of the last modification time and the user responsible for those modifications, ensuring that your application can keep a record of updates made to entities. Combined with `@CreatedDate` and `@CreatedBy`, they provide a complete auditing solution for entity lifecycle management.
