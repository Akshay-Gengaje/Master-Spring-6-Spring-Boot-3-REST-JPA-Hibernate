# @EntityListener Annotation -

The `@EntityListeners` annotation in Spring Data JPA and JPA itself is used to specify callback methods that will respond to lifecycle events of the entity, such as when an entity is created, updated, removed, or loaded from the database. These callback methods are located in a listener class, and they allow you to perform custom logic before or after certain entity lifecycle events.

### 1. **Purpose and Functionality**

The `@EntityListeners` annotation is typically used to attach a class that listens for and responds to entity lifecycle events. These events occur at key moments during the entity's lifecycle, such as:

- Before an entity is persisted
- After an entity is loaded
- Before or after an entity is updated or removed

The listener class can define methods that are annotated with JPA lifecycle annotations (e.g., `@PrePersist`, `@PostPersist`, `@PreUpdate`, `@PostRemove`).

### 2. **Lifecycle Event Annotations**

| **Annotation** | **Description**                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@PrePersist`  | Called before the entity manager persist operation is executed (before the entity is inserted into the database). |
| `@PostPersist` | Called after the persist operation is completed (after the entity has been inserted into the database).           |
| `@PreUpdate`   | Called before the entity manager update operation is executed (before the entity is updated in the database).     |
| `@PostUpdate`  | Called after the update operation is completed (after the entity has been updated in the database).               |
| `@PreRemove`   | Called before the entity manager remove operation is executed (before the entity is removed from the database).   |
| `@PostRemove`  | Called after the remove operation is completed (after the entity has been removed from the database).             |
| `@PostLoad`    | Called after an entity is loaded into the persistence context (after the entity is retrieved from the database).  |

### 3. **Basic Example of `@EntityListeners`**

Let’s assume you have an entity class `Author`, and you want to track certain lifecycle events using an entity listener.

#### 3.1 Creating the Listener Class

First, create a listener class that defines methods to handle entity lifecycle events.

```java
import javax.persistence.PrePersist;
import javax.persistence.PostPersist;
import javax.persistence.PreUpdate;
import javax.persistence.PostUpdate;

public class AuthorEntityListener {

    @PrePersist
    public void prePersist(Object entity) {
        System.out.println("Before persisting: " + entity);
    }

    @PostPersist
    public void postPersist(Object entity) {
        System.out.println("After persisting: " + entity);
    }

    @PreUpdate
    public void preUpdate(Object entity) {
        System.out.println("Before updating: " + entity);
    }

    @PostUpdate
    public void postUpdate(Object entity) {
        System.out.println("After updating: " + entity);
    }
}
```

- **`@PrePersist`**: This method will be called before the entity is persisted to the database.
- **`@PostPersist`**: This method will be called after the entity has been persisted.
- **`@PreUpdate`**: This method will be called before the entity is updated.
- **`@PostUpdate`**: This method will be called after the entity is updated.

#### 3.2 Attaching Listener to Entity

Next, attach this listener to the entity class using the `@EntityListeners` annotation:

```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.EntityListeners;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
@EntityListeners(AuthorEntityListener.class)
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example:

- The `AuthorEntityListener` class will be triggered for lifecycle events on the `Author` entity.
- Before and after `persist` and `update` operations, the appropriate methods in `AuthorEntityListener` will be executed.

### 4. **Multiple Entity Listeners**

You can define multiple entity listeners for a single entity by listing multiple classes in the `@EntityListeners` annotation:

```java
@Entity
@EntityListeners({AuthorEntityListener.class, AnotherEntityListener.class})
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}
```

In this case, both `AuthorEntityListener` and `AnotherEntityListener` will respond to the lifecycle events for the `Author` entity.

### 5. **Lifecycle Annotations in Entity Classes**

Instead of defining an external listener class, you can also place lifecycle callback methods directly within the entity class by using the JPA lifecycle annotations like `@PrePersist`, `@PostPersist`, and others.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @PrePersist
    public void prePersist() {
        System.out.println("Author is about to be persisted: " + this);
    }

    @PostPersist
    public void postPersist() {
        System.out.println("Author has been persisted: " + this);
    }
}
```

### 6. **Use Cases for Entity Listeners**

- **Audit logging**: You can use entity listeners to log audit information, such as when an entity is created, updated, or deleted.
- **Data integrity**: You can enforce custom business rules or update related entities before or after certain lifecycle events.
- **Automatic value population**: Automatically set default values or track timestamps like creation and modification times.

#### Example: Audit Logging with Listener

```java
import javax.persistence.PrePersist;
import javax.persistence.PreUpdate;

public class AuditListener {

    @PrePersist
    @PreUpdate
    public void setAuditFields(Object entity) {
        if (entity instanceof Auditable) {
            Auditable auditableEntity = (Auditable) entity;
            auditableEntity.setLastModifiedBy("Admin");
            auditableEntity.setLastModifiedDate(LocalDateTime.now());
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the `AuditListener` checks if the entity is `Auditable` and updates the fields accordingly. The listener is then attached to the entities that require auditing.

### 7. **Best Practices**

- **Separation of concerns**: Use separate listener classes to decouple business logic from entity code. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Use of `@EntityListeners` vs direct annotations**: Use `@EntityListeners` when the logic should be applied to multiple entities or when reusability and separation are important.

### Conclusion

The `@EntityListeners` annotation allows you to register a listener class for entity lifecycle events, providing a powerful way to execute custom logic at specific points in an entity’s lifecycle. It's commonly used for audit logging, data validation, and enforcing business rules before or after database operations. By implementing listeners externally, you achieve a clean separation of concerns, making your entity classes more focused on representing data rather than business logic.
