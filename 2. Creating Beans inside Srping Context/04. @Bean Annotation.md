# @Bean Annotation

In the Spring Framework, the `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that a method produces a bean that should be managed by the Spring container. Beans are objects that are instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

### Understanding `@Bean`

- **Method-Level Annotation:** The `@Bean` annotation is applied to a method in a `@Configuration` class. The method's return value is registered as a bean within the Spring IoC container.
- **Custom Bean Naming:** By default, the bean's name is the same as the method name, but you can specify a custom name using the `name` attribute of the `@Bean` annotation.
- **Singleton by Default:** By default, beans created by `@Bean` are singletons. This means that the Spring container will create and manage a single instance of the bean.

### Example of `@Bean` Annotation

Let's go through a simple example:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }

    @Bean
    public MyController myController() {
        return new MyController(myService());
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. **`@Configuration`:** This annotation indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.
   
2. **`@Bean` Method for `MyService`:**
   - The `myService()` method is annotated with `@Bean`, so Spring will treat it as a bean definition.
   - The Spring IoC container will call this method, and the return value (`new MyService()`) will be registered as a bean within the container.

3. **`@Bean` Method for `MyController`:**
   - The `myController()` method is also annotated with `@Bean`.
   - Notice that it takes the `MyService` instance as a parameter, which is provided by Spring. This demonstrates Spring's ability to handle dependencies between beans automatically.

### Usage

To use these beans, you would typically create a Spring application context and retrieve beans like this:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

        MyController controller = context.getBean(MyController.class);
        controller.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this code:

- **`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class)`:** This creates an application context using the configuration provided by the `AppConfig` class.
- **`getBean(MyController.class)`:** This retrieves the `MyController` bean from the Spring container.

# Custom Name to Bean

In Spring Framework, you can give a custom name to a bean defined with the `@Bean` annotation by using the `name` attribute of the `@Bean` annotation. This is useful when you want to differentiate between multiple beans of the same type or simply provide a more meaningful name for the bean.

### Defining a Bean with a Custom Name

Here’s how you can assign a custom name to a bean:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean(name = "customMyService")
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }

    @Bean(value = "customMyController")
    public MyController myController() {
        return new MyController(myService());
    }
    @Bean("customMyController2")
    public MyController2 myController() {
        return new MyController(myService());
    }
}
```

In this example:

- **`@Bean(name = "customMyService")`:** The `name` attribute specifies the name of the bean as `customMyService`.
- **`@Bean(name = "customMyController")`:** The `name` attribute specifies the name of the bean as `customMyController`.

### Using Beans with Custom Names

To retrieve a bean by its custom name, you use the `ApplicationContext` to get the bean by name. Here’s how you can do it:

```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

        // Retrieve bean by custom name
        MyService myService = (MyService) context.getBean("customMyService");
        MyController myController = (MyController) context.getBean("customMyController");

        // Use the retrieved beans
        myController.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this code:

- **`context.getBean("customMyService")`:** Retrieves the `MyService` bean by its custom name `customMyService`.
- **`context.getBean("customMyController")`:** Retrieves the `MyController` bean by its custom name `customMyController`.

### Additional Notes

1. **Bean Name Convention:** If you don't specify a name, Spring will use the method name as the default bean name.
2. **Ambiguity Handling:** Custom names are especially useful in cases where there might be multiple beans of the same type. By giving them different names, you can avoid ambiguity when retrieving them.

### Summary

- **`@Bean`** is a method-level annotation used in Spring to define a bean that the Spring container manages.
- The annotated method’s return value is treated as a bean.
- Beans defined using `@Bean` are by default singletons and can be customized.
- The Spring container automatically manages dependencies between beans, ensuring that they are wired together correctly.
- Use the `name` attribute of the `@Bean` annotation to specify a custom name for a bean.
- Retrieve beans by their custom names using the `ApplicationContext`’s `getBean` method with the name as a parameter.
- Custom names help manage and differentiate beans, especially in complex configurations with multiple beans of the same type.

This annotation is a key part of Spring's configuration capabilities, allowing for fine-grained control over bean creation and dependency injection.
