# HttpSecurity -

The reason you created the `SecurityFilterChain` bean in the Spring Security configuration is to customize the security rules for your application without extending the now-deprecated `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Let me explain the purpose in detail.

### Why Use the `SecurityFilterChain` Bean?

1. **Customization of Security Filters**: The `SecurityFilterChain` bean allows you to define custom security rules for HTTP requests, like which endpoints require authentication, what type of login mechanism is used, and more. In your example, it was used to define that all pages and APIs should be accessible without authentication.

2. **Replaces `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`**: Previously, Spring Security configurations were done by extending `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. However, from Spring Security 5.7 onwards, this approach has been deprecated in favor of the more flexible and functional `SecurityFilterChain` bean.

   - Old way:
     ```java
     @Configuration
     public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
         @Override
         protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
             http
                 .authorizeRequests()
                 .anyRequest().permitAll();
         }
     }
     ```

   - New way (using `SecurityFilterChain`):
     ```java
     @Bean
     public SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
         http
             .authorizeHttpRequests((requests) -> requests
                 .anyRequest().permitAll());
         return http.build();
     }
     ```

3. **Bean Configuration**: By using a Spring `@Bean`, you are making this configuration a part of the Spring application context. Spring will automatically use this bean to configure security settings for your application.

4. **Modular and Declarative**: With `SecurityFilterChain`, you can declare multiple beans for different security filters and easily reuse or customize them. It’s more modular compared to the older approach, and it fits well with the functional, lambda-based configuration style.

### Summary of Why This Bean is Used:
- It customizes security for your application (e.g., to permit all URLs).
- It’s the modern, preferred approach in Spring Security, replacing the old `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
- Spring automatically uses this bean for security configuration.

By defining `SecurityFilterChain` as a bean, Spring knows how to configure security for your web application in a clean and modern way.
